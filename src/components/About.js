            <p>
               I am currently working on a Web3 defi wallet dapp, and a sustainable off-grid homestead.
               Other smart contract studies:
               <li>HyperApp- Parcel, dapp development.</li>

               I have been studying numerous wallets, platforms and protocols for decentralization, anonymity, 
               censorship resistance, security, UI/UX, etc., and taking notes for over a year, with increasing
               focus and passion.
